# Machine-Learning-Project
This is my final group project of my undergraduate machine learning class.
In this project, we predicted Spanish Renfe Railway ticket price by applying machine learning techniques.

In this project, I: 
  - preprocessed the raw data for our project purpose, 
  - used principal component analysis to find out the variables that might be relevant to the ticket price, and
  - trained the models with different machine learning strategies. 


Originally, our project was stored in Kaggle.com:
